# Grades App

## Use
This is a pretty niche one, to be honest - for earthworks gradespeople to visualize and calculate some of the concepts needed on site.

## Features
Shot Graphic
Slope Graphic

## Future
Numeric shot calulator because it's faster
Numeric slope calculator, also faster.
Both are just more boring to make and less useful for training.
